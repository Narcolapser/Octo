So I've seen a really useful idea. The loggers "org.hibernate.sql" and "org.hibernate.type" provide a lot of sql information. Probably not all of it, but it's a good place to start. So I'm starting to work towards having a panel that tells you what's up with SQL. In doing this I'm finally getting down to the nitty gritty on interfacing with the log files. This isn't going to be easy. I really need to move forward with caution so I don't get myself into a terrible mess a third time.
