# Octo

### What does Octo stand for?
Nothing. This project was originally called "bookish-octo-computing-machine" but that was clunky to say. It was a automatic name generated by github. I eventually settled on calling it Octo, taking the second word from it's original name. 

### What is Octo?
a uPortal utility program that I wrote because I'm going batty with all these greppings!

Features working:
*	Load servers and authentication from file
*	Connect to servers and display available logs
*	Fix filters to leverage the SQL backend
*	Edit logging files to turn certain logs on and off
*	Add servers dynamically

Features to work on:
*	Filter contents of the logs
*	Download Log file
*	Download Multiple Log Files
*	Copy selected section of log file.
*	Nest logs: there are instances of the same log for different days. I'd like to
		nest these so they are all available, but still compact.
*	Add logfiles dynamically
*	Zip Files before downloading
*	Keep logs up to date: no information from after you open the file for the first time gets pulled in.
*	Progress bar on log file being opened/downloaded.
*	Modularize the panels so you can choose which panels you want to load or not. (also makes making new ones easier)

Some dream features:
*	Re-deploy Portlets
